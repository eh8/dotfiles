# eh8's dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, which use [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/). I was inspired by [chimurai's dotfiles](https://github.com/chimurai/dotfiles).

To rapidly provision a macOS or Arch Linux machine:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eh8/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```

> These dotfiles contains a number of hardcoded values and critically assumes you use 1Password.
